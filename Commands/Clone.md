# Git Clone
Cloning a repository is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository.  It will be a clone, meaning it has all trzcked commits and commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull dates from the original repository.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:
```
git clone https://github.com/ElvenfiftyAcademy/TerminalDunegon.git
```
