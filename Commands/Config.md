# git config
When First setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to set up your id entity.
For example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:
git config --global user.name "Arnold Shortman" 
git config --global user.email arnoldshortman202@gmail.com
For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Start) documentation.
